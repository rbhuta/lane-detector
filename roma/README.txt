This directory contains:

- This README.txt file
- file ImageOwners.txt describing the images owners
- file CalibrationFileFormat.pdf describing parameters within files param.cal and param.cam of each subdirectories
- matlab file meangraph.m allows to display ROC and DICE curves, with help of matlab functions loadroc.m abd loadlist.m
- 116 images organized in 10 subdirectories named:

BDXD54
BDXN01
IRC041500
IRC04510
LRAlargeur13032003
LRAlargeur14062002
LRAlargeur26032003
RD116
RouenN8IRC051900
RouenN8IRC052310

Each subdirectory contains:
- original images in jpg format
- associated reference images (ground truth) in pgm format 
  (the name of the reference is e.g. Rima.pgm for an original image named ima.jpg) 
- camera calibration parameters file named param.cam 
- image parameters file named param.cal
- the list of the original images in file img.mov
- the list of the reference images in file Rimg.mov in the same order than img.mov
- the list of the normal conditions images in file imgnormal.mov
- the list of the adverse conditions images in file imgadvlight.mov
- the list of the curved road images in file imghighcurv.mov

For using the matlab meangraph function which displays the ROC and DICE curves, the extraction algorithm must produce
a file with the following format for each image. On each line of this file, 5 values must appears in following order: 
- threshold value used by the extraction algorithm
- True Positive number of pixels
- False Positive number of pixels
- True Negative number of pixels
- False Negative number of pixels
For each image with name imagename, the filename generated by the extraction algorithm must be with the format : 
/sequence/situation/algoname_imagename.txt
where:
- sequence is the images subdirectory (BDXD54, BDXN01, IRC041500, IRC04510, LRAlargeur13032003, LRAlargeur14062002, RAlargeur26032003, RD116, RouenN8IRC051900, RouenN8IRC052310)
- situation is the name of the subdirectory where files generated by the extraction algorithm are saved
- algoname is the name of the used extraction algorithm
Then just type under matlab the command "meangraph(situation,imagelist,algoname,color,dispflag)"
where:
- imagelist is the name of the file with the list of the images to be used (img.mov, imgnormal.mov, imgadvlight.mov, imghighcurv.mov)
- color is the curve color for display
- dispflag is 0 to display roc curve and 1 to display dice curve
